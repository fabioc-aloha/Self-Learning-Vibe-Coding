# Mobile Performance Optimization Episode Template

## Phase 1: Performance Analysis and Profiling
- Use platform-specific profiling tools (Instruments, Android Profiler, Flutter DevTools)
- Analyze app startup time and runtime performance
- Identify memory leaks and excessive memory usage
- Profile network requests and data transfer efficiency
- Analyze battery usage and CPU utilization

## Phase 2: Optimization Strategy Development
- Prioritize performance issues based on user impact
- Plan code optimization approaches (algorithms, data structures)
- Design caching strategies for data and assets
- Plan lazy loading and code splitting implementation
- Consider platform-specific optimization techniques

## Phase 3: Implementation and Testing
- Implement performance optimizations systematically
- Optimize image loading and asset management
- Implement efficient list rendering and virtualization
- Optimize database queries and data access patterns
- Test performance improvements across different devices

## Phase 4: Monitoring and Continuous Improvement
- Set up performance monitoring and alerting
- Implement performance budgets and quality gates
- Conduct regular performance testing and regression testing
- Document optimization techniques and best practices
- Plan ongoing performance maintenance and monitoring

Focus on measurable performance improvements and user experience

# App Store Submission Episode Template

## Phase 1: Pre-Submission Preparation
- Complete thorough testing across target devices and OS versions
- Prepare app store assets (screenshots, descriptions, keywords)
- Review and ensure compliance with platform guidelines
- Implement proper app versioning and release notes
- Configure app store metadata and category selection

## Phase 2: Build Preparation and Code Signing
- Create production builds with proper optimization
- Configure code signing certificates and provisioning profiles
- Implement proper security measures and data protection
- Test release builds on physical devices
- Prepare app bundle/APK with appropriate configurations

## Phase 3: Submission and Review Process
- Submit app through platform-specific channels (App Store Connect, Google Play Console)
- Monitor submission status and respond to review feedback
- Address any rejection issues and resubmit if necessary
- Plan release timeline and coordinate marketing efforts
- Prepare for post-launch monitoring and support

## Phase 4: Post-Launch Management
- Monitor app performance and user feedback
- Track download metrics and user engagement
- Plan updates and feature releases
- Manage app store optimization (ASO) strategies
- Handle user reviews and customer support

Focus on successful app store approval and user acquisition

### Step 6: Meta-Cognitive Files Integration

The learning.instructions.md, meta-cognition.instructions.md, consolidation.prompt.md, self-assessment.prompt.md, meta-learning.prompt.md, and cognitive-health.prompt.md files from previous setups apply to mobile development as well, focusing on continuous improvement of mobile development capabilities.

## ðŸ“± Mobile Development Setup Validation

After creating all files, verify mobile development setup:

1. **Check mobile development file structure**: Ensure all directories and mobile-specific files exist
2. **Validate VS Code settings**: Confirm mobile development instruction files are recognized
3. **Test mobile development activation**: Try mobile "@" commands in Copilot chat
4. **Verify cross-platform integration**: Check that methodology properly balances native and cross-platform approaches

## ðŸš€ Mobile Development Quick Start Commands

After setup, test with these mobile-specific commands:

**Mobile Development Tests**:
- `@workspace Help me create a React Native app architecture` (Should activate app-architecture.prompt.md)
- `Develop a cross-platform UI component` (Should activate ui-component.prompt.md)
- `Optimize app performance for iOS and Android` (Should activate performance-optimization.prompt.md)

**Platform-Specific Tests**:
- `Implement iOS-specific navigation patterns` (Should activate ios-development.instructions.md)
- `Create Android Material Design components` (Should activate android-development.instructions.md)
- `Build Flutter widget with proper state management` (Should activate flutter-development.instructions.md)

**Meta-Mobile Development Tests**:
- `@workspace Assess your mobile development assistance quality` (Should activate self-assessment.prompt.md)
- `How can you improve cross-platform development support?` (Should activate meta-learning.prompt.md)
- `Monitor your mobile development architecture health` (Should activate cognitive-health.prompt.md)
