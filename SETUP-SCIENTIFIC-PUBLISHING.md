# Scientific Publishing Cognitive Architecture Setup Guide

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR GITHUB COPILOT**: This file contains complete setup instructions for implementing the Self-Learning Vibe Coding cognitive memory architecture optimized for scientific publishing, including peer-reviewed research, manuscript preparation, journal submission, grant writing, and comprehensive academic collaboration workflows.

## ðŸ”¬ Scientific Publishing Automated Setup Protocol

**Execute these steps in order to establish a complete cognitive architecture system for scientific publishing:**

### Step 1: VS Code Configuration (Required)

Add these settings to VS Code `settings.json`:

### Step 2: Create Scientific Publishing Directory Structure

Create this exact folder structure in the project root:

```
