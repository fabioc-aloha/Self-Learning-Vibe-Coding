# Coding Cognitive Architecture Auto-Setup Guide

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR GITHUB COPILOT**: This file contains complete setup instructions for implementing the Self-Learning Vibe Coding cognitive memory architecture optimized for software development and coding workflows. Follow these instructions to create all necessary directories, files, and configurations.

## ðŸš€ Coding Automated Setup Protocol

**Execute these steps in order to establish a complete cognitive architecture system for software development:**

### Step 1: VS Code Configuration (Required)

Add these settings to VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
  "chat.promptFiles": true,
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": [".github/instructions"]
}
```

**Access settings.json**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"

### Step 2: Create Directory Structure

Create this exact folder structure in the project root:

```
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ copilot-instructions.md          # Global Declarative Memory
