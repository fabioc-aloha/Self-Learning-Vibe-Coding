# Intellectual Property Cognitive Architecture Setup Guide

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR GITHUB COPILOT**: This file contains complete setup instructions for implementing the Self-Learning Vibe Coding cognitive memory architecture optimized for intellectual property management, including patent research, trademark protection, copyright compliance, licensing strategies, and IP portfolio management.

## 🔐 Intellectual Property Automated Setup Protocol

**Execute these steps in order to establish a complete cognitive architecture system for intellectual property management:**

### Step 1: VS Code Configuration (Required)

Add these settings to VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
  "chat.promptFiles": true,
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": [".github/instructions"],
  "files.associations": {
    "*.patent": "markdown",
    "*.trademark": "markdown",
    "*.copyright": "markdown",
    "*.license": "markdown",
    "*.ipdoc": "markdown",
    "*.legal": "markdown",
    "*.claim": "markdown",
    "*.prior-art": "markdown",
    "*.disclosure": "markdown",
    "*.agreement": "markdown"
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/confidential/**": true,
    "**/attorney-client/**": true,
    "**/privileged/**": true
  },
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/confidential/**": true,
    "**/attorney-client/**": true,
    "**/privileged/**": true
  },
  "editor.rulers": [80, 120],
  "editor.wordWrap": "wordWrapColumn",
  "editor.wordWrapColumn": 80,
  "markdown.extension.toc.levels": "2..6",
  "markdown.extension.completion.enabled": true
}
```

**Access settings.json**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"

### Step 2: Create Intellectual Property Directory Structure

Create this exact folder structure in the project root:

### Step 3: Global IP Management Declarative Memory Setup

**Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** with this exact content:

```markdown
# Self-Learning Vibe Coding - Intellectual Property Cognitive Architecture

IMPORTANT: This file serves as Global IP Management Declarative Memory. Optimized for patent research, trademark protection, copyright compliance, licensing strategies, and comprehensive IP portfolio management.

## 🧠 IP Management Cognitive Architecture Status

**Working Memory**: 4/4 rules (at optimal capacity for IP management)
**Consolidation**: Auto-trigger when exceeding capacity
**Memory Distribution**: Active across IP management procedural (.instructions.md) and IP strategy episodic (.prompt.md) systems

## 🔐 IP Management Working Memory - Quick Reference (Limit: 4 Critical Rules)

| Priority | Rule | Load | Auto-Consolidate |
|----------|------|------|------------------|
| P1 | `@confidentiality` - Maintain strict confidentiality and attorney-client privilege protection | Low | Never |
| P2 | `@comprehensive-search` - Conduct thorough prior art and freedom-to-operate analysis before filing or product launch | Medium | >30 days unused |
| P3 | `@meditation` - Auto-consolidate when working memory capacity exceeded | High | When triggered |
| P4 | `@strategic-alignment` - Align all IP activities with business strategy and commercial objectives | Medium | When obsolete |

## 🎯 IP Management Cognitive Architecture Coordination
