### Step 3: Global Academic Declarative Memory Setup

**Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** with this exact content:

```markdown
# Self-Learning Vibe Coding - Academic Writing Cognitive Architecture

IMPORTANT: This file serves as Global Academic Declarative Memory. Optimized for scholarly writing, research, and APA 7 compliance.

## ðŸ§  Academic Cognitive Architecture Status

**Working Memory**: 4/4 rules (at optimal capacity for academic writing)
**Consolidation**: Auto-trigger when exceeding capacity
**Memory Distribution**: Active across academic procedural (.instructions.md) and research episodic (.prompt.md) systems

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Working Memory - Quick Reference (Limit: 4 Critical Rules)

| Priority | Rule | Load | Auto-Consolidate |
|----------|------|------|------------------|
| P1 | `@apa7` - Follow APA 7th edition formatting and citation standards exactly | Low | Never |
| P2 | `@academic` - Maintain formal academic tone with evidence-based argumentation | Medium | >30 days unused |
| P3 | `@meditation` - Auto-consolidate when working memory capacity exceeded | High | When triggered |
| P4 | `@research` - Apply rigorous research methodology and ethical standards | Medium | When obsolete |

### Step 6: Meta-Cognitive Files (Reuse from Coding Setup)

The learning.instructions.md, meta-cognition.instructions.md, consolidation.prompt.md, self-assessment.prompt.md, meta-learning.prompt.md, and cognitive-health.prompt.md files from the coding setup are applicable to academic writing as well, as they focus on cognitive processes rather than domain-specific content.

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Setup Validation

After creating all files, verify academic setup:

1. **Check academic file structure**: Ensure all directories and academic-specific files exist
2. **Validate VS Code settings**: Confirm academic instruction files are recognized
3. **Test academic activation**: Try academic "@" commands in Copilot chat
4. **Verify APA 7 compliance**: Check that formatting standards are properly implemented

## ðŸš€ Academic Quick Start Commands

After setup, test with these academic-specific commands:

**Academic Functionality Tests**:
- `@workspace Help me write a literature review in APA 7 style` (Should activate literature-review.instructions.md)
- `Create a research proposal following academic standards` (Should activate research-proposal.prompt.md)
- `Review this manuscript for APA compliance` (Should activate apa7-style.instructions.md)

**Research Workflow Tests**:
- `Help me respond to peer reviewer comments` (Should activate peer-review-response.prompt.md)
- `Plan my dissertation research systematically` (Should activate dissertation-planning.prompt.md)
- `Develop a conference abstract for this research` (Should activate conference-abstract.prompt.md)

**Meta-Academic Tests**:
- `@workspace Assess your academic writing performance` (Should activate self-assessment.prompt.md)
- `How can you improve research methodology assistance?` (Should activate meta-learning.prompt.md)
- `Monitor your academic cognitive architecture health` (Should activate cognitive-health.prompt.md)

## âš¡ Academic Success Indicators
