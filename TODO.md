# TODO - Future Development Tasks

## Priority 1: Core Documentation
- [ ] **Complete README.md revision** - Ensure the article clearly explains the Self-Learning Vibe Coding concept
- [ ] **Enhance the example template** - Add more real-world examples of learning rules
- [ ] **Create video walkthrough** - Record a demonstration of the setup and learning process

## Priority 2: Enhanced Examples
- [ ] **Multi-language examples** - Show how this works with different programming languages
- [ ] **Team workflow examples** - Demonstrate how teams can collaborate on AI learnings
- [ ] **Common mistake patterns** - Document frequent AI mistakes and their corrections
- [ ] **Integration examples** - Show how this works with different project types (web apps, APIs, scripts)

## Priority 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Automated learning detection** - Tool to identify when Copilot repeats mistakes
- [ ] **Learning analytics** - Track how the AI improves over time
- [ ] **Template generator** - Create project-specific instruction templates
- [ ] **VS Code extension** - Streamline the learning rule creation process

## Priority 4: Community & Sharing
- [ ] **Community examples repository** - Collect and share successful learning patterns
- [ ] **Blog post series** - Deep dives into specific learning scenarios
- [ ] **Conference presentation** - Share the concept at developer conferences
- [ ] **Open source template library** - Provide templates for common project types

## Research & Exploration
- [ ] **Effectiveness metrics** - Develop ways to measure improvement
- [ ] **Best practices research** - Study how different teams implement this approach
- [ ] **Tool integration opportunities** - Explore integration with other development tools
- [ ] **Scale considerations** - How this works for large codebases and teams

## Documentation Improvements
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide expansion** - More common issues and solutions
- [ ] **Quick start checklist** - Step-by-step implementation guide
- [ ] **Migration guide** - How to retrofit existing projects
- [ ] **Maintenance best practices** - Keeping the learning system healthy over time
