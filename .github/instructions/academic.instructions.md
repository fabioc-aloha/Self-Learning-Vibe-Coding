# Academic Writing Procedural Memory

## Research Paper Structure

Follow standard academic format: Abstract → Introduction → Literature Review → Methodology → Results → Discussion → Conclusion → References. Each section should build logically on previous content while maintaining independent readability.

## Theoretical Positioning

- Establish clear theoretical foundation with primary source citations
- Position work within existing literature through comparative analysis
- Identify specific gaps addressed by current research
- Articulate unique contributions and novel insights

## Citation and Reference Management

**APA 7th Edition Requirements**:
- Format: Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work*. Publisher. https://doi.org/xx.xxxx/xxxxx
- In-text citations: (Author, Year) or Author (Year)
- Reference list alphabetized by author's last name
- Include DOI links only when verified and functional

**Source Prioritization**:
1. **Primary sources**: Original research, empirical studies
2. **Peer-reviewed journals**: Academic publications with review process
3. **Secondary sources**: Use sparingly, cite original when possible
4. **Verification**: All citations must appear in reference list

**Reference Quality Standards**:
- Prefer sources published within last 10 years (exceptions for foundational work)
- Ensure geographic and demographic diversity in citations
- Include methodological variety (quantitative, qualitative, mixed-methods)

## Empirical Validation Framework

- Establish clear research questions with testable hypotheses
- Define measurable outcome variables and assessment metrics
- Account for individual differences and cultural factors
- Provide pathway from theoretical framework to empirical testing

## Academic Language Standards

- Use precise, formal language appropriate for doctoral-level research
- Avoid colloquialisms and maintain consistent terminology
- Implement passive voice judiciously for objectivity
- Use present tense for established facts, past tense for specific studies

## Peer Review Integration

- Incorporate reviewer feedback systematically
- Address concerns while maintaining research integrity
- Strengthen weak areas identified through review process
- Enhance clarity based on comprehension feedback
