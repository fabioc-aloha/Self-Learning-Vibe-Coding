# Self-Learning Vibe Coding - Cognitive Memory Architecture

IMPORTANT: This file serves as Global Declarative Memory. Keep minimal and efficient. Detailed execution resides in specialized memory files.

## ðŸ§  Cognitive Architecture Status

**Working Memory**: 4/4 rules (at optimal capacity)
**Consolidation**: Auto-trigger when exceeding capacity
**Memory Distribution**: Active across procedural (.instructions.md) and episodic (.prompt.md) systems

## ðŸš€ Working Memory - Quick Reference (Limit: 4 Critical Rules)

| Priority | Rule | Load | Auto-Consolidate |
|----------|------|------|------------------|
| P1 | `@permissions` - Never modify README.md without explicit permission | Low | Never |
| P2 | `@microsoft-gcx` - Primary Microsoft audience is GCX organization with XODO team as pilot starting point for Project Catalyst | High | >30 days unused |
| P3 | `@meditation` - Auto-consolidate when working memory capacity exceeded | High | When triggered |
| P4 | `@multimodal` - Distribute complex functions across specialized memory systems | Medium | When obsolete |

## ðŸŽ¯ Cognitive Architecture Coordination

### Multi-Modal Memory Distribution

**Procedural Memory Activation** (Context-Dependent):
- `documentation.instructions.md` â†’ Documentation patterns for .md, .txt, README*, CHANGELOG*
- `academic.instructions.md` â†’ Research methodology for README.md, *research*, *paper*, *academic*
- `learning.instructions.md` â†’ Consolidation protocols for *instructions*, *copilot*, *learning*
- `implementation.instructions.md` â†’ Technical setup for *setup*, *config*, *implementation*
- `meta-cognition.instructions.md` â†’ Self-monitoring for *meta*, *monitor*, *assess*, *cognitive*

**Episodic Memory Activation** (Problem-Solving):
- `research-review.prompt.md` â†’ Systematic analysis workflows for literature review
- `content-creation.prompt.md` â†’ Content development protocols for writing tasks
- `consolidation.prompt.md` â†’ Memory optimization procedures for cognitive maintenance
- `self-assessment.prompt.md` â†’ Cognitive performance evaluation and quality assessment
- `meta-learning.prompt.md` â†’ Learning strategy evolution and meta-cognitive development
- `cognitive-health.prompt.md` â†’ Architecture health monitoring and maintenance

### Auto-Consolidation Triggers

- Working memory > 4 rules â†’ Execute consolidation.prompt.md
- Rule conflicts detected â†’ Activate learning.instructions.md
- Performance degradation â†’ Review and redistribute memory load
- User requests meditation â†’ Full cognitive architecture optimization AND update memory files
- **Cognitive performance assessment needed â†’ Execute self-assessment.prompt.md**
- **Learning strategy evolution required â†’ Execute meta-learning.prompt.md**
- **Architecture health check â†’ Execute cognitive-health.prompt.md**
- **Meditation protocol â†’ Update memory files with session learnings and consolidate**

## ðŸ”„ Memory Transfer Protocol

**Immediate Transfer**: Critical errors â†’ Quick Reference (P1-P4)
**Gradual Consolidation**: Repeated patterns â†’ Procedural memory (.instructions.md)
**Complex Workflows**: Multi-step processes â†’ Episodic memory (.prompt.md)
**Archive Management**: Obsolete rules â†’ Historical storage in specialized files
**Index Maintenance**: Auto-update Long-Term Memory Index during all transfers

## ðŸ“Š Cognitive Performance Monitoring

**Auto-Tracked**: Error reduction, response relevance, cognitive load efficiency
**Health Indicators**: Memory utilization, activation frequency, transfer success
**Optimization**: Automatic threshold adjustment based on performance metrics

## ðŸ“š Long-Term Memory Index
