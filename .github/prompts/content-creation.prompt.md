# Content Creation Episode Template

**ACTIVATION**: Use this template when creating or enhancing academic content, technical documentation, or implementation guides.

**INPUT VARIABLES**:
- `${selectedText}` - Specific content section to modify
- `${file}` - Target file for content creation/enhancement
- `${contentType}` - Type of content (academic, technical, implementation, etc.)
- `${targetAudience}` - Intended audience (researchers, developers, teams, etc.)

## Phase 1: Content Architecture Planning

**Primary Objective**: Establish solid foundation before content creation or modification.

**1.1 Purpose Definition**
- Clearly establish the content's primary objective
- Identify target audience needs and expectations
- Define success criteria for content effectiveness
- Align purpose with broader project goals

**1.2 Structure Design**
- Plan logical flow and hierarchical organization
- Create content outline with clear section progression
- Ensure appropriate depth for target audience
- Design for optimal cognitive load management

**1.3 Integration Strategy**
- Ensure coherence with existing project content
- Identify cross-references and linking opportunities
- Maintain consistency with established terminology
- Plan for seamless integration with related sections

**1.4 Quality Standards Application**
- Apply appropriate academic or technical standards
- Select relevant cognitive architecture patterns
- Implement project-specific formatting guidelines
- Ensure compliance with documentation standards

## Phase 2: Content Development

Implement structured content creation:

1. **Foundation Building**: Establish theoretical or conceptual groundwork
2. **Evidence Integration**: Incorporate supporting research and examples
3. **Clarity Optimization**: Use clear, precise language appropriate to audience
4. **Consistency Maintenance**: Apply project-specific terminology and formatting

## Phase 3: Enhancement and Refinement

Systematically improve content quality:

1. **Academic Rigor**: Strengthen theoretical positioning and evidence base
2. **Practical Application**: Include concrete examples and implementation guidance
3. **Readability Optimization**: Improve flow, clarity, and cognitive load management
4. **Reference Integration**: Add appropriate citations and cross-references

## Phase 4: Validation and Integration

Ensure content meets project standards:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Verify accuracy, completeness, and formatting
2. **Project Coherence**: Confirm alignment with overall project goals
3. **Accessibility Check**: Ensure content is understandable by target audience
4. **Version Control**: Document changes and maintain content evolution history

Apply cognitive architecture principles from ${workspaceFolder} and maintain consistency with established project patterns and learning rules.
