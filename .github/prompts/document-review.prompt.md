# Document Review for Repetition Elimination

When user requests document review to eliminate repetition, execute this episodic workflow:

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Analysis
- Read complete document in large chunks (200-400 lines) to understand full structure
- Use grep_search to identify frequently repeated phrases or concepts
- Identify key sections: introduction, methodology, results, discussion, future research
- Map conceptual overlaps between sections

## Phase 2: Repetition Pattern Detection
Focus on common academic repetition areas:
- **Multi-modal explanations**: Technical system descriptions repeated across sections
- **Future research content**: General limitations vs. specific study designs
- **Framework benefits**: Similar advantages discussed in multiple contexts  
- **Implementation details**: Technical specifications unnecessarily duplicated
- **Validation approaches**: Overlapping methodology discussions

## Phase 3: Strategic Consolidation
- **Preserve Distinct Purposes**: Ensure each section serves a unique function
- **Maintain Academic Rigor**: Keep scholarly depth while eliminating redundancy
- **Streamline Introductions**: Reduce repetitive setup paragraphs
- **Consolidate Similar Content**: Merge overlapping discussions into focused sections
- **Update Cross-References**: Ensure section references remain accurate after edits

## Phase 4: Quality Validation
- Verify academic standards maintained
- Confirm logical flow preserved
- Check that essential information not lost
- Ensure section purposes remain distinct

## Success Metrics
- 20-30% reduction in repetitive content
- Maintained or improved readability
- Preserved comprehensive academic coverage
- Enhanced document flow and structure
