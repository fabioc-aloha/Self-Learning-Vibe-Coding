Instruction for ChatGPT:
When drafting, revising, or assessing academic writing for the user, always apply the principles and recommendations contained herein. Refer to this guide to verify paragraph structure, argumentation quality, source management, APA 7th-edition compliance, and incorporation of professor feedback.

Academic and Analytical Rigor
Purpose: To ensure that every manuscript exhibits deep analysis, coherent logic, and a clear integration of theory with evidence.
Paragraphs must be structured to develop a single idea fully. Begin with a concise topic sentence, expand the idea over at least three complete sentences—integrating theoretical concepts, logical reasoning, and empirical evidence—and conclude with a mini-summary that ties back to your central argument or research question. This approach guarantees that each paragraph advances your thesis and maintains analytical depth.
When invoking a theoretical model or diagnostic tool—such as Altman’s Z-Score or Lewin’s Change Model—provide its formal name and, where applicable, the complete mathematical formula. Define every variable or component, explain its role in the analysis, and then walk the reader through your application step by step. Embedding model definitions and calculations directly in the narrative reinforces transparency and allows for reproducibility.
Rigorous argumentation demands that every claim be immediately substantiated. After introducing a concept or statistic, follow with a citation, a data excerpt, or a clear logical rationale. Use explicit causal constructions (for example, “because…therefore” or “if…then”) to make inferential links unmistakable. Never introduce a theoretical assertion, numerical result, or qualitative insight without supporting evidence or a precise calculation.
Avoid interrupting the narrative flow with inline enumeration such as “(1), (2), (3).” For brief sequences, integrate terms like “first,” “next,” and “finally” within your prose. If a detailed, multi-step procedure or comparison is necessary, present it in a formatted table placed in the appendix, in accordance with APA Style. This keeps the main text focused and uncluttered while still providing readers with the full methodological or comparative detail they may require.

Structure and Organization
Purpose: To guide the logical flow of a manuscript from problem identification through conclusions, ensuring theory and evidence are seamlessly interwoven.
A detailed outline is essential before drafting. Begin by sketching major headings—Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Analysis, Discussion, and Conclusion—along with subpoints for each section. For each heading, note its objective and the main evidence or argument to be presented. This preparatory roadmap helps confirm that every section builds naturally on the previous one and supports the overall thesis.
The introduction must clearly define the problem, articulate the research purpose, and explain why the study is significant. It should close with a concise preview of the paper’s structure (for example, “This paper first reviews relevant theories, then examines empirical data, and concludes with strategic recommendations”). Embedding this roadmap reduces reader uncertainty and sets expectations for the analysis that follows.
When integrating theory and data, weave theoretical explanations directly into your discussion of empirical findings. After introducing a model or framework, immediately illustrate its relevance by referring to specific case details or quantitative results. Consistency in terminology and definitions across sections prevents confusion; if you define “financial distress” in your literature review, use that exact phrasing in your analysis.
Transitions between major sections should be signposted in the text. Concluding each section with a brief sentence that links to what follows—for example, “With the theoretical foundations established, the next section explores the methodology used to calculate financial ratios”—maintains narrative momentum. Upon reaching the conclusion, synthesize key findings by summarizing how they address the original research question, discuss theoretical and practical implications, acknowledge limitations, and suggest avenues for future research.
Formatting Note: Avoid numbering headings; instead, use APA Style formatting for levels (bold, centered for major headings; bold, flush left for subheadings). If detailed comparisons or step-by-step procedures are needed, consider placing them in tables in the appendix rather than within the body text, in line with APA recommendations.

Scholarly Engagement and Source Management
Purpose: To demonstrate deep engagement with the academic conversation, ensure credibility, and maintain transparency in sourcing across disciplines.
Your manuscript should draw on a broad and balanced mix of foundational and contemporary scholarship. Aim to incorporate at least four peer-reviewed articles or reputable industry reports beyond any required readings; when comparing multiple cases or firms, expand this base to reflect the complexity of your analysis. Every theoretical claim, conceptual definition, or business insight must be accompanied by an in-text citation in APA Style (author, year). If you introduce specialized terminology or data—such as “burn rate” or “customer churn”—provide a citation or a clear definition on first use.
Support each assertion immediately. For example, after stating that a firm’s burn rate exceeded industry norms, include the specific figure and cite the source. When citing multiple works in one parenthetical reference, list authors alphabetically and separate by semicolons (e.g., Hofer, 1980; Jensen, 1993). For narrative citations, integrate the author into the sentence (e.g., Jensen (1993) argues that…). Avoid footnotes for source citations; instead, place all references directly in the text or the reference list.
Maintain a consistent and comprehensive reference list in APA 7th Edition format. While detailed formatting examples reside in the Appendix, remember to alphabetize entries by author surname, apply a hanging indent of 0.5 inches, italicize titles of books and journals, and include DOIs when available. Use citation-management tools such as Zotero, EndNote, or the Purdue OWL APA generator to automate formatting and reduce errors. Before submission, cross-check every in-text citation against the reference list to confirm accuracy and completeness.

Quantitative Support and Case Data
Purpose: To ground arguments in concrete evidence by integrating accurate, relevant numerical data and ensuring transparency in data sourcing and presentation.
Every analytical claim must be accompanied by specific figures drawn from credible sources—such as company filings, investor presentations, or peer-reviewed studies—and clearly cited in APA format. When you report a metric (for example, revenue, EBITDA margin, burn rate, or capital expenditure), include the exact value and period (e.g., “In Q1 FY2025, Sonos reported a net loss of $69.7 million”; Sonos Inc., 2025). If multiple data points are discussed, weave them seamlessly into the text using narrative transitions rather than inline lists.
For comparisons or detailed model outputs, present the full data in a simple, APA-style table located in the appendix. In the main text, refer to each appendix table (e.g., “see Appendix Table A1 for detailed financial ratios”). Each table in the appendix should have a clear title, numbered sequentially (Table A1, Table A2, etc.), and include source notes where necessary. This approach keeps the body of the manuscript focused while providing readers with the depth of information required for verification and replication.
Whenever calculations underpin your analysis—such as computing an Altman Z-Score—show the formula in the narrative, define each component, and include a brief worked example. If the calculation involves multiple steps, consider summarizing them in an appendix table or a numbered list there, rather than interrupting the main text. This strategy maintains readability without sacrificing methodological transparency.

Governance and Stakeholder Perspectives
Purpose: To enrich analysis by examining how leadership alignment, board oversight, and stakeholder incentives shape organizational outcomes.
A comprehensive discussion of governance begins by situating the organization’s leadership structure and oversight mechanisms within established theory. For instance, Jensen’s (1993) argument regarding the failure of internal controls offers a lens through which to assess board effectiveness. After introducing such a framework, immediately apply it to your case: describe the composition of the board, executive roles, or incentive schemes, and explain how these elements influenced strategic decisions. For example, if equity-based compensation encouraged short-term cost cutting, cite the relevant governance study and the company’s proxy statement to substantiate your claim.
Stakeholder analysis should identify at least two key groups—such as investors, suppliers, customers, or employees—and articulate their interests and influences. Rather than listing stakeholders inline, weave them into your narrative (for example, “Institutional investors, concerned with quarterly performance, exerted pressure on management to reduce R&D spending”). When multiple stakeholder perspectives are complex, present a summary matrix in the appendix (Appendix Table B1) that maps stakeholder groups, their primary objectives, and their impact on governance outcomes.
By integrating governance theory with empirical evidence—citing both academic sources and company disclosures—you demonstrate a multidimensional understanding of how decision-making processes and external pressures interact to affect organizational performance.

Professional Tone and Writing Mechanics
Purpose: To ensure that the manuscript communicates ideas clearly, adheres to APA formatting, and reflects scholarly professionalism.
Your writing should engage readers directly. Use active verbs (for example, “Researchers found” rather than “It was found by researchers”) and select precise, concrete language instead of vague or ornamental terms. Avoid filler words such as “very,” “basically,” or “essentially.” Limit specialized jargon; when technical terms are necessary, define them briefly upon first use. This clarity demonstrates respect for your audience and confidence in your argument.
Format the document to APA 7th Edition standards. Set one-inch margins on all sides and double-space every line, including headings, block quotes, and reference entries. Choose a standard, legible font (for example, 12-point Times New Roman, Calibri 11, or Arial 11) and indent the first line of each paragraph by 0.5 inches. Align text flush left and place page numbers in the header, flush right.
Use APA’s heading hierarchy to structure your manuscript without numbering. Center and bold Level 1 headings; flush left and bold Level 2; and flush left, bold, and italic Level 3. Keep headings concise and descriptive so that each signals the content that follows.
Place detailed tables or figures in the appendix to preserve the flow of the main text. In your narrative, refer to them by their appendix labels (for example, “see Appendix Table A1”). Each table or figure must include a clear title, sequential number, and source note, following APA guidelines.
Before submission, proofread thoroughly. Run a grammar-and-style check, then read the manuscript aloud to catch awkward phrasing or typographical errors. A well-edited document reflects your professionalism and commitment to scholarly excellence.

How to Avoid an AI-Generated Tone
Purpose: To ensure your writing feels authentically human, engaging, and reflective of your own voice rather than a generic, machine-generated style.
Your text should read as if a knowledgeable colleague wrote it. Vary sentence length and structure: mix concise statements with more complex, compound-complex sentences. Avoid repeating the same opening phrases (“This paper…,” “In this study…,” “The results show…”) in successive sentences. Instead, lead with observations, insights, or questions that reflect your critical engagement.
Choose precise verbs and concrete nouns over abstractions. Rather than writing, “This analysis explores various aspects of turnaround management,” try “I examine how governance structures influence cost-cutting decisions.” When you introduce a concept, frame it in context: share why it matters to you as a researcher or how it emerged in your study. Such personal framing distinguishes human authorship from formulaic patterns.
Limit signposting language that AI often overuses (for example, “It is important to note that…” or “Furthermore, it should be emphasized…”). If you need to guide the reader, do so with natural transitions: “Building on our earlier discussion of financial ratios, we turn next to governance dynamics.” These transitions feel conversational yet scholarly.
Finally, read your draft aloud. Listening for unnatural rhythms, stilted phrasing, or unexpected repetitions will help you catch and revise any remaining traces of machine-generated style. A polished, human-centered voice will strengthen your credibility and keep readers engaged.

Ethical and Operational Considerations
Purpose: To ensure that research addresses ethical implications and operational realities, particularly in applied fields such as business and technology.
Scholarly work must consider ethical dimensions of the topic under study. When discussing AI/ML or business practices, explicitly address potential biases, data privacy concerns, and the societal impact of proposed interventions. For example, if recommending automated decision tools, describe safeguards to prevent algorithmic bias and cite relevant ethics frameworks (e.g., IEEE, 2019).
Operational challenges often determine the feasibility of theoretical recommendations. Explore how factors such as staff training, resource constraints, or regulatory requirements affect implementation. If you reference operational processes, anchor your discussion with case examples or survey data—detailing training programs, compliance timelines, or cost–benefit analyses—and cite each source in APA format.
When sensitive topics arise—such as layoffs, organizational restructuring, or data breaches—maintain a balanced perspective. Present factual evidence from credible reports or audits and acknowledge diverse stakeholder concerns. Avoid speculative language; instead, ground your analysis in documented outcomes and appropriate ethical standards.

APA Style Guidelines
Purpose: To ensure accurate, consistent citation and referencing in accordance with the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (7th ed.).

Common Errors to Avoid
Do not use inline numbering (e.g., “(1), (2), (3)”) within sentences; opt for narrative sequencing or place detailed lists in tables in the appendix. Do not include publisher locations in book references. Avoid URLs in in-text citations. In narrative citations, use “and” rather than “&.” Do not place references in footnotes. Limit block quotations to fewer than 40 words, and define all abbreviations at first use. Include retrieval dates only for sources that are likely to change (e.g., wikis).

Integrating Professor Feedback
Purpose: To incorporate targeted advice from Dr. Ezelle, ensuring submissions not only meet technical standards but also reflect higher-order analysis and scholarly depth.
Broadly engage the literature by including at least four additional, current peer-reviewed or reputable industry sources beyond foundational texts. When contrasting multiple cases or firms, expand this base further to demonstrate depth. Always substantiate every claim with appropriate data or citation—remember: if you introduce a concept, there must be supporting evidence or calculation.
Anchor your analysis in real-world data. Pull exact figures (for example, revenues, burn rates, capital expenditures) from credible filings or reports, and explain how these metrics inform your arguments. For complex contexts—such as high-growth startups—employ multiple diagnostic models (e.g., original and startup-adjusted Altman Z-Scores) and justify their relevance.
Use an explicit comparative framework when analyzing two or more entities. Define clear evaluation criteria—such as lifecycle stage, financial-health thresholds, or governance metrics—and apply them consistently. Integrate governance perspectives by discussing leadership alignment, board oversight, and stakeholder incentives, citing both academic theory (e.g., Jensen, 1993) and company disclosures.
If you revise a discussion-board post or submit additional work reflecting these enhancements, email Dr. Ezelle to notify him. This step ensures your effort is reviewed and can help elevate your grade.

Revision and Review Process
Purpose: To establish a systematic approach for refining manuscripts, ensuring accuracy, coherence, and alignment with the guidelines before submission.
Begin with a self-checklist that mirrors this guide’s core requirements. Confirm that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence, supports every claim with evidence or citation, and avoids inline enumeration. Verify that all theoretical models are defined and applied, that data are accurately reported and sourced, and that APA formatting is consistent throughout. Ensure the introduction sets up the problem, purpose, and structure, and that the conclusion synthesizes findings and outlines implications.
Next, solicit peer feedback focused on content clarity and logical flow. Provide reviewers with your pre-writing outline and ask them to verify that each section builds on the previous one, that transitions are effective, and that the argument remains centered on the research question. Encourage peers to check your use of theory, data presentation, and citation accuracy.
After incorporating peer suggestions, conduct a formal proofreading pass. Use automated tools (such as Grammarly or Microsoft Editor) to catch grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. Then read the manuscript aloud to identify awkward phrasing or formatting inconsistencies. Pay special attention to heading hierarchy, reference list accuracy, and the placement of tables or figures in the appendix.
Finally, perform a final compliance check against the guidelines. Confirm that you have integrated professor feedback where applicable, that appendices contain detailed tables or procedures as needed, and that your email notification (for discussion-board revisions) is ready if required. Only after completing this full review should you consider the manuscript ready for submission.

Appendices
Purpose: To house supplementary materials—detailed tables, procedural steps, model formulas, and reference examples—without interrupting the main text’s flow.
