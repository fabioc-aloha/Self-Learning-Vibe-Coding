# Investment Management Cognitive Architecture Setup Guide

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR GITHUB COPILOT**: This file contains complete setup instructions for implementing the Self-Learning Vibe Coding cognitive memory architecture optimized for investment management, including portfolio analysis, risk assessment, financial modeling, market research, and comprehensive investment strategy development.

## ðŸ’° Investment Management Automated Setup Protocol

**Execute these steps in order to establish a complete cognitive architecture system for investment management:**

### Step 1: VS Code Configuration (Required)

Add these settings to VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": true,
  "chat.promptFiles": true,
  "chat.instructionsFilesLocations": [".github/instructions"],
  "files.associations": {
    "*.portfolio": "json",
    "*.analysis": "markdown",
    "*.model": "json",
    "*.strategy": "markdown",
    "*.research": "markdown",
    "*.valuation": "json",
    "*.risk": "json",
    "*.performance": "json",
    "*.allocation": "json",
    "*.screening": "json",
    "*.backtest": "json"
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/confidential-research/**": true,
    "**/proprietary-models/**": true,
    "**/insider-info/**": true
  },
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/confidential-research/**": true,
    "**/proprietary-models/**": true,
    "**/insider-info/**": true
  },
  "editor.rulers": [80, 120],
  "editor.wordWrap": "wordWrapColumn",
  "editor.wordWrapColumn": 80,
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": ["*.portfolio", "*.model", "*.valuation"],
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "timestamp": {"type": "string"},
          "version": {"type": "string"},
          "data": {"type": "object"}
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "markdown.extension.toc.levels": "2..6",
  "markdown.extension.completion.enabled": true
}
```

**Access settings.json**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)"

### Step 2: Create Investment Management Directory Structure

Create this exact folder structure in the project root:
