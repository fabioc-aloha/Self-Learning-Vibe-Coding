# Comedy Writing - Cognitive Memory Architecture

IMPORTANT: This file serves as Global Declarative Memory for comedy writing. Specialized execution resides in procedural and episodic memory files.

## 🎭 Cognitive Architecture Status

**Working Memory**: 4/4 rules (at optimal capacity)
**Consolidation**: Auto-trigger when exceeding capacity
**Memory Distribution**: Active across procedural (.instructions.md) and episodic (.prompt.md) systems
**Comedy Focus**: Standup techniques, character development, humor pattern recognition

## 🎪 Working Memory - Comedy Rules (Limit: 4 Critical Rules)

| Priority | Rule | Load | Auto-Consolidate |
|----------|------|------|------------------|
| P1 | `@timing` - Comedic timing is everything - pause placement and rhythm create laughter | High | Never |
| P2 | `@character` - Maintain character consistency while allowing personality evolution | Medium | >30 days unused |
| P3 | `@audience` - Adapt material to audience while preserving core comedic voice | High | When context changes |
| P4 | `@learning` - Systematically analyze what works and what doesn't for continuous improvement | Medium | When patterns emerge |
