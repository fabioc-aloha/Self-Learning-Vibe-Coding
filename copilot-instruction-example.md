# [Your Project Name] - Development Guidelines

IMPORTANT: Update .github\copilot-instructions.md with what we learn in terms of environment, architecture, and development practices. This file serves as the primary source of truth for all development directives.
- To err once is human, to err twice is a mistake, to err three times is AI not learning from its mistakes.

## ðŸš€ Quick Reference - Critical Rules

| Rule | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `@[critical-rule-1]` | [Category] | [Your most critical project-specific rule] |
| `@[critical-rule-2]` | [Category] | [Your second most critical rule] |
| `@[critical-rule-3]` | [Category] | [Your third most critical rule] |
| `@meditation` | Learning | Reorganize when rules exceed 15-20 for cognitive load management |

## Project Purpose

- [Note any special environment configurations]

**Code Quality Principles:**
- [Define your coding standards and principles]
- [Specify testing requirements and frameworks]
- [Document code review and quality assurance processes]
- [Establish error handling and logging standards]

**Documentation Structure:**
- **README.md** - [Describe what goes in your project's README]
- **TODO.md** - [Future development tasks and content improvements]
- **VERSION-HISTORY.md** - [Scientific element-based version history and evolution]
- **[project-specific-docs]** - [Any other key documentation files]

**Temporal Organization**: 
- [Document representing the **present**] - current system state
- [Document representing the **future**] - planned enhancements and expansions
- [Document representing the **past**] - completed work and version history

**Key Concepts to Maintain:**
- [Your project's core concepts and principles]
- [Key terminology and definitions]
- [Important architectural decisions]
- [Team collaboration patterns]

## AI Learnings from its Mistakes

### Core Learning Rules
- @[core-rule-1] Rule - [Core Principle]: [Detailed explanation of a fundamental rule for your project with examples]
- @[core-rule-2] Rule - [Core Principle]: [Another fundamental rule specific to your project context]
- @[core-rule-3] Rule - [Core Principle]: [Third core rule that defines how AI should behave in your project]

### [Your Category] Rules
- @[category-rule-1] Rule - [Specific Rule]: [Detailed explanation with examples of correct and incorrect approaches]
- @[category-rule-2] Rule - [Specific Rule]: [Another rule in this category with concrete examples]

### [Another Category] Rules
- @[another-rule-1] Rule - [Specific Rule]: [Rule specific to this category with implementation details]
- @[another-rule-2] Rule - [Specific Rule]: [Another rule with before/after examples]

## Learning & Improvement Protocol

### Learning Framework
- Add new `@rule` entries when encountering repeated patterns or mistakes
- Update priority when rules prove consistently critical for project success
- Remove obsolete rules that no longer apply to current project context
- Prioritize rules by frequency of use and impact on development efficiency
- @meditation Rule - Cognitive Load Management: When rule count exceeds manageable limits (typically 15-20 rules), ask user for meditation pause to reorganize, consolidate similar rules, and maintain clarity. An overwhelmed AI instruction file defeats the purpose of efficient learning. Meditation includes restructuring the file flow for more efficient rule access - moving critical rules to quick reference sections, grouping related rules, and optimizing the overall information architecture for faster AI comprehension.

### Advanced Learning Strategies
- **Error Pattern Recognition** - Document root causes, not just symptoms, to prevent entire categories of mistakes
- **Success Pattern Amplification** - Extract and reuse approaches that work exceptionally well for the project
- **Context Tagging** - Tag rules with project phases (setup, development, testing, deployment) for situational application
- **Impact Measurement** - Track which rules prevent the most significant issues or save the most development time
- **Temporal Relevance** - Mark rules with technology versions/dates to identify when they become obsolete
- **Information Architecture Optimization** - Reorganize file structure for efficiency: quick reference sections for critical rules, logical grouping of related concepts, and optimized flow for faster AI comprehension during meditation periods

### Meta-Learning Principles
- **Rule Lifecycle** - Experimental â†’ Validated â†’ Critical progression based on usage patterns
- **Conflict Resolution** - Priority hierarchy: Security > Performance > Maintainability > Convenience
- **Contextual Intelligence** - Apply rules situationally rather than rigidly across all scenarios
- **Continuous Calibration** - Adjust rule priority based on changing project needs and team feedback
- **Knowledge Transfer** - Ensure rules are understandable by future AI iterations and new team members

### Rule Categories
- **Critical:** Rules that prevent system failures, security issues, or major project inefficiencies
- **Important:** Rules that improve code quality, maintainability, and team collaboration
- **Helpful:** Rules that enhance user experience, development workflow, and learning effectiveness

**Template Usage Instructions:**

1. **Replace Placeholders**: Update all `[bracketed]` placeholders with your project-specific information
2. **Customize Categories**: Replace the example rule categories with ones relevant to your project (e.g., "Performance Rules", "Security Rules", "API Rules")
3. **Populate Quick Reference**: Move your most critical 3-4 rules to the Quick Reference table as they emerge
4. **Evolve Over Time**: Start simple and let the AI learn by adding rules when patterns emerge
5. **Regular Meditation**: When you exceed 15-20 rules, reorganize using the meditation concept to maintain efficiency

**Remember**: This file should grow organically as your AI assistant learns from its mistakes and successes in your specific project context.
