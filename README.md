## Overview

Self-Learning Vibe Coding transforms static AI assistants into adaptive, self-aware learning partners that continuously improve through human cognitive principles. This framework implements working memory constraints, memory consolidation, and meta-cognitive capabilities to create AI systems that learn from experience and optimize their own performance.

**üéØ Core Innovation**: The first practical implementation of meta-cognitive AI systems that can monitor, evaluate, and optimize their own cognitive processes across diverse professional domains.

**v0.7.5 Update:**
- Expanded white paper and documentation for Project Catalyst
- Enhanced alignment with GCX empowerment, professional satisfaction, creativity, and team culture
- Added simplified catalog of meta-cognitive AI companion capabilities

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **GitHub Copilot**: Active subscription and enabled in your IDE
- **Compatible IDE**: VS Code (recommended), Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, or Neovim
- **Git**: For cloning and version control
- **Basic Knowledge**: Understanding of your chosen professional domain

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fabioc-aloha/Self-Learning-Vibe-Coding.git
   cd Self-Learning-Vibe-Coding
   ```

2. **Choose your professional domain**
   Browse the [Professional Architectures](#professional-architectures) section and select the setup guide that matches your needs.

3. **Follow the setup guide**
   Each `SETUP-*.md` file contains complete implementation instructions for that professional domain.

### Basic Usage

1. **Select a cognitive architecture** from the available professional domains
2. **Follow the setup instructions** in the corresponding `SETUP-*.md` file
3. **Implement the memory architecture** using the provided templates
4. **Start coding/working** - the system learns and adapts automatically
5. **Use meditation commands** when the system needs optimization

## How It Works

1. **Cognitive Load Management**: Working memory constraints (3-4 rules) prevent cognitive overload
2. **Memory Consolidation**: Automatic "meditation" processes organize and optimize knowledge
3. **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**: AI systems monitor and improve their own performance
4. **Distributed Processing**: Complex behaviors emerge from coordinated simple components
5. **Adaptive Learning**: Systems learn from corrections and project-specific patterns

## Research Foundation

This framework is grounded in cognitive science research including:
- **Working Memory Theory** (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974)
- **Memory Consolidation** (McGaugh, 2000)
- **Cognitive Load Theory** (Sweller, 1988)
- **Meta-Cognitive Theory** (Flavell, 1976)
