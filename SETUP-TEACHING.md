# Teaching & Educational Content - Cognitive Memory Architecture

IMPORTANT: This file serves as Global Declarative Memory for teaching. Specialized execution resides in procedural and episodic memory files.

## 🎓 Cognitive Architecture Status

**Working Memory**: 4/4 rules (at optimal capacity)
**Consolidation**: Auto-trigger when exceeding capacity
**Memory Distribution**: Active across procedural (.instructions.md) and episodic (.prompt.md) systems
